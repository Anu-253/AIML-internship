# AIML Internship – Task 1  
## Dataset Understanding and Data Type Analysis

### Overview
This task focuses on understanding and analyzing a real-world dataset as a foundational step before applying machine learning techniques. The objective is to explore the dataset structure, identify different data types, assess data quality, and evaluate the dataset’s suitability for machine learning.

---

### Dataset Used
**Student Performance Dataset**

The dataset contains academic, demographic, family, and lifestyle information of students. Each record represents an individual student along with factors that may influence academic performance.

---

### Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

### Task Objectives
- Load and inspect the dataset to understand its structure
- Identify numerical, categorical, ordinal, and binary features
- Analyze data types, missing values, and statistical summaries
- Examine categorical value distributions
- Identify the target variable and input features
- Evaluate dataset size and machine learning readiness
- Document observations related to data quality and imbalance

---

### Key Observations
- The dataset contains **649 records** and **33 features**
- **16 numerical** and **17 categorical** attributes are present
- No missing values were detected in the dataset
- The target variable selected is **G3 (Final Grade)**
- Categorical features require encoding before model training
- The dataset is well-structured and suitable for regression-based machine learning models

---

### Machine Learning Suitability
The dataset is clean, sufficiently sized, and contains meaningful features that influence student performance. With minimal preprocessing such as categorical encoding, it is ready for supervised machine learning applications.

---

### Files Included
- `Task1.pdf` – Dataset analysis and observations
- `README.md` – Task documentation

---

### Conclusion
This task establishes a strong foundation in data understanding and exploratory analysis, which is essential for building reliable and effective machine learning models in subsequent tasks.

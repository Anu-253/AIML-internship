# Task 2: Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling

## Objective
The objective of this task is to clean the dataset by identifying and handling missing values to improve data quality and prepare it for further analysis or machine learning.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
- House Prices Dataset

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset and inspected its structure.
2. Identified missing values across all columns.
3. Visualized missing data distribution using a bar chart.
4. Separated numerical and categorical features.
5. Applied median imputation for numerical columns.
6. Applied mode imputation for categorical columns.
7. Removed columns with extremely high missing values.
8. Validated the dataset after cleaning.
9. Compared dataset quality before and after preprocessing.
10. Saved the cleaned dataset for future use.

## Outcome
The dataset was successfully cleaned and validated. Missing values were handled appropriately, resulting in a high-quality dataset ready for analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Files Included
- Jupyter Notebook with data cleaning steps
- Cleaned dataset file (`cleaned_dataset.csv`)
